# ui-extractor

A Claude Code skill that analyzes screen recordings and websites to extract implementation specs, design systems, and UI patterns.

## Installation

Install via the [Skills Library](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add alpex-ai/ui-extractor
```

Or add directly to Claude Code:

```bash
claude skills add https://github.com/alpex-ai/ui-extractor
```

## Requirements

- **ffmpeg** - Required for video processing
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```

- **jq** - Required for JSON processing (Figma export)
  ```bash
  brew install jq
  ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use natural language to analyze recordings:

### Basic Analysis

```
Analyze the recording at ./my-app-demo.mov
```

### Design System Extraction

```
Extract the design system from ./competitor.mp4 and export to Figma
```

### App Comparison

```
Compare my app at ./my-app.mov with the reference at ./target.mov
```

### Temporal/Motion Analysis

```
Analyze ./animation-demo.mov with motion detection enabled
```

### URL Recording (Automatic)

Simply provide a URL and the skill will automatically record the website:

```
Analyze stripe.com

Record linear.app and extract the design system

Analyze competitor.com in mobile dark mode
```

The recording captures:
- Page load and SPA hydration
- Hover states on interactive elements
- Scroll through entire page content
- Scroll-triggered animations

### Browser Tab Recording (Authenticated Sites)

For sites requiring login, have the page open in your browser and the agent will **record** it:

```
Record my open browser tab

Analyze the tab I have open

Record this authenticated dashboard
```

The agent will:
1. Start screen recording on your open tab
2. Scroll through the page, hover over elements
3. Export the recording and extract frames
4. Analyze using the same pipeline as URL recordings

This works with any authenticated session - Figma, Notion, internal dashboards, etc.

### Static CSS Extraction

For design system extraction without video:

```
Extract the design system from https://example.com
```

### Importing Local Recordings

Screen recordings are saved to `~/Desktop`, which agents can't access due to macOS security. Copy recordings into your project:

```bash
cp ~/Desktop/Screen\ Recording*.mov ./recording.mov
```

Then: `Analyze ./recording.mov`

### Trigger Phrases

The skill activates when you mention:

| Intent | Example Phrases |
|--------|-----------------|
| URL Recording | "Analyze stripe.com", "Record linear.app", "What does example.com look like?" |
| Browser Tab Recording | "Record my open tab", "Analyze the tab I have open", "Record this authenticated page" |
| Full Analysis | "Analyze the recording...", "Extract specs from...", "What components does this app use?" |
| Design System | "Extract the design system from...", "Get the colors/typography from...", "Export to Figma..." |
| Comparison | "Compare ... with ...", "How does my app differ from...", "What's missing compared to..." |
| Temporal | "Analyze animations in...", "Extract motion timings from...", "Detect transitions in..." |

## Capabilities

- **URL Recording**: Automatically record any website with simulated interactions
- **Browser Tab Extraction**: Extract from authenticated sites open in your browser
- **Full Analysis**: Extract complete implementation spec from a recording
- **Design System Only**: Extract colors, typography, spacing for Figma export
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare your app against a reference recording
- **Temporal Analysis**: Motion detection, animation extraction, and transition timing

## Quality Levels

Control extraction density with quality presets:

| Quality | FPS | Use Case |
|---------|-----|----------|
| low | 0.5 | Long recordings (>60s), simple UIs |
| default | 1 | Most recordings (15-60s) |
| high | 2 | Short recordings (<15s), complex UIs |

Custom FPS from 0.1-10 is also supported.

## Output

The skill generates:

### Implementation Spec (Markdown)
- Screen inventory with frame references
- Component catalog with variants and usage
- Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- User flows with triggers and transitions
- Implementation recommendations

### Design System (JSON)
```json
{
  "colors": { "primary": { "value": "#007AFF", "usage": "Primary actions" } },
  "typography": { "heading": { "size": "24px", "weight": "600" } },
  "spacing": { "sm": "8px", "md": "16px", "lg": "24px" },
  "motion": { "fast": "150ms", "normal": "250ms" }
}
```

### Export Formats
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind config
- Figma Variables (JSON)
- W3C Design Tokens (DTCG)

## Figma Integration

Export design systems directly to Figma:

```
Export the design system to Figma

Push these tokens to my Figma file ABC123
```

Supports:
- Figma Variables API integration
- MCP tools for direct component creation
- Color, typography, and spacing tokens

## Advanced Features

### Motion Analysis
Enable `--include-metadata` for temporal analysis:
- Per-frame motion scores
- Animation duration detection
- Scene boundary identification
- Transition type classification

### Diff Frame Generation
Visualize changes between frames:
- Highlights pixel differences
- Identifies animation patterns (fade, slide, scale)
- Useful for transition analysis

### Adaptive Sampling
Motion-weighted frame extraction:
- More frames during high-motion segments
- Efficient context usage
- Better animation capture
